# linux-configs
- Download the init.sh with git/curl/wget and run. Will install and setup most of the setup automatically except for font.
- Note: In some cases the powerlevel10k config's icon may not render properly and 'p10k configure' may have to be run manually.

My Linux customization configs for:
- zsh
- powerlevel10k
- vim

Others to be added as needed


## Note:
- Will need to install zsh, oh-my-zsh, p10k, zsh-autosuggestions, and zsh-syntax-highlighting manually until I get a script to install everything made
