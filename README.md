# dotfiles
- Download the init.sh with git/curl/wget and run. Will install and setup most of the setup automatically except for font.
- Script and configs are currently W.I.P

dotfiles for:
- zsh
- powerlevel10k
- vim

Others to be added as needed


## Note:
- zsh, git, and wget are installed with this script in case they are not instlled already
  - Package manager is checked to limit incompatibility
- In some cases the powerlevel10k config's icon may not render properly and 'p10k configure' may have to be run manually.
